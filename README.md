# ToDo-using-CoreData
This is a example of a Todo App usuing core data. This app can also be greatly improved and is by no means done.
Using realm would be a far superior option to use for an app like this, unless you plan on the app only being for IOS products. Realm can use the same data base across different platforms or yoy could still target one OS.
